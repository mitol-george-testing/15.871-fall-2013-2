Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics_ as it was taught by John Sterman and Hazhir Rahmandad in Fall 2013.

_15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics_ is a half-semester introductory course. Students can take _15.871_ alone, or combine it with [_15.872 System Dynamics II_](/courses/15-872-system-dynamics-ii-fall-2013/). Taken in sequence the courses constitute the introductory sequence in system dynamics. Successful completion of both _15.871_ and _15.872_ is a prerequisite for advanced courses in system dynamics, work as a research or teaching assistant in the field, or careers using system dynamics.

During this first half of the semester, 2 class sections were taught by John Sterman and Hazhir Rahmandad, and 2 additional sections for Sloan Fellows were taught simultaneously by Nelson Repenning. 6 teaching assistants worked as a team to cover all 4 sections over the semester.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

_15.871_ and _15.872_ introduce students to system dynamics modeling for the analysis of business policy and strategy. Students will learn to visualize a business organization in terms of the structures and policies that create dynamics and regulate performance. The course uses simulation models, case studies, and management flight simulators to develop principles of policy design for successful management of complex strategies, and to improve our understanding of the ways in which an organization’s performance is related to its internal structure and operating policies as well as those of customers, competitors, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
